'The basic concept is extremely simple: an open space of collaborative work and exchange of ideas.' Mark Wigley


## Scenario
The system embraces the core idea behind the Studio X Golbal - open platforms for creativity and communication interconected between each other.
'Not a school, think-tank, gallery, performance space, communication center, or officeâ€“but elements of all.
Studio-X is an open flexible work area with exhibition space, book gallery, lecture space, meeting space, some offices and a serious espresso machine...'
The space is a system of modules (furniture, panles, canvas etc.) that can move along predifined axes according to the different functions.
It is controled locally and globally through an App. 

Example scenario: - 08:00PM - Beijing - Lecture - panels (furniture) arranged accordinlgy: open space, projection
                  - 08:00AM - NYC - office - decides to join the lecture - by selecting the 'Join' option, the space rearranges
                  
Studio X becomes a space of overlapping events.
